# auto_wah-guitar-effect
the	crux	of	the	wah	wah	effect	is	modulation	of	a passband		Performers	are	able	to	
create	a	musical	effect	by	emphasising	and	accenting	notes by	controlling	the	depth	and	rate	of	this	
modulation	along	with	what	they	play	on	their	instrument.	This	is	achieved	by	‘sweeping’	a	bandpass	
filter	with	a	narrow	Q	up	and	down	the	frequency	spectrum,	usually	between	a	defined	upper	and	lower	
frequency.
